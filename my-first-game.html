            If you are not a person who plays games and consoles frequently
            there is such a thing called the console wars. These wars have been
            going on for quite some time. Although they have ended recently, I
            bet there is still multiple people that will still say that one
            console is better then the other. Personally I think the xbox is
            good because I have always been with it, im hoping to have the new
            PS5 for the new spiderman game.

            There is also the people that play on PC and nintendo switch. For
            the PC people the console players usally hate them, but most of the
            time we are just jealous of how we can´t get a PC. There is also the
            nintendo players, which are a special case, because if they play
            nintendo games like Smash Bros or Mario Kart with their friends they
            are most likely going to be cool people. Although if they try to
            play other games on it like mainstream games for example Fortnite or
            Call Of Duty, you can´t really be mad at them if they suck at it.
            that is because the nintendo switch controller for anything other
            then nintendo games kinda suck.
